 * Implementation of a simple trie, also known as a prefix
 * tree. Upon construction, the tree is populated by a
 * dictionary. In addition to storing the prefixes for each
 * word in the dictionary, the frequency with which each
 * prefix appears in the dictionary is also stored. For
 * example, after constructing a tree from a dictionary 
 * which contains two-thousand words beginning with the 
 * prefix "ab", then calling tree.getFrequency("ab") will
 * return 2000.
